A modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord's user API written in Python.

| **Note:**
| Automating user accounts is against the Discord ToS. This library is a proof of concept and I cannot recommend using it. Do so at your own risk.

Fork Changes
------------

These changes have become too numerous to mention, so check out our `docs <https://discordpy-self.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

**Credits:**

- `Rapptz <https://github.com/Rapptz>`_ for the original library this fork is based on. Without it, the project would not exist.
- `arandomnewaccount <https://www.reddit.com/user/obviouslymymain123/>`_ for help when the project was first started.

Key Features
-------------

- Modern Pythonic API using ``async`` and ``await``.
- Proper rate limit handling.
- Optimised in both speed and memory.
- Mostly compatible with the upstream ``discord.py``.
- Prevents user account automation detection.
- Implements vast amounts of the user account-specific API. For a non-exhaustive list:

  * Sessions
  * Read states
  * Connections
  * Relationships
  * Experiments
  * Protobuf user settings
  * Application/team management
  * Store/SKUs/entitlements
  * Billing (e.g. subscriptions, payments, boosts, promotions, etc.)
  * Interactions (slash commands, buttons, etc.)

Installing
----------

**Python 3.8 or higher is required.**

To install the library without full voice support, you can just run the following command:

.. code:: sh

    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m pip install -U discord.py-self

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py-self

Otherwise to get voice support you should run the following command:

.. code:: sh

    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m pip install -U "discord.py-self[voice]"

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py-self[voice]


To install the development version, do the following:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self
    $ cd discord.py-self
    $ python3 -m pip install -U .[voice]


Optional Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `PyNaCl <https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/>`__ (for voice support)

Please note that on Linux installing voice you must install the following packages via your favourite package manager (e.g. ``apt``, ``dnf``, etc) before running the above commands:

* libffi-dev (or ``libffi-devel`` on some systems)
* python-dev (e.g. ``python3.6-dev`` for Python 3.6)

Using with Upstream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to use the library alongside upstream ``discord.py``, you can install ``selfcord.py`` instead of ``discord.py-self``. Check out the `renamed branch <https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self/blob/renamed/README.rst>`_ for more information.

Quick Example
--------------

.. code:: py

    import discord

    class MyClient(discord.Client):
        async def on_ready(self):
            print('Logged on as', self.user)

        async def on_message(self, message):
            # only respond to ourselves
            if message.author != self.user:
                return

            if message.content == 'ping':
                await message.channel.send('pong')

    client = MyClient()
    client.run('token')

Bot Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: py

    import discord
    from discord.ext import commands

    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='>', self_bot=True)

    @bot.command()
    async def ping(ctx):
        await ctx.send('pong')

    bot.run('token')
