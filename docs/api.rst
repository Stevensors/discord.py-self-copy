.. currentmodule:: discord

API Reference
===============

The following section outlines the API of discord.py-self.

.. note::

    This module uses the Python logging module to log diagnostic and errors
    in an output independent way.  If the logging module is not configured,
    these logs will not be output anywhere.  See :ref:`logging_setup` for
    more information on how to set up and use the logging module with
    discord.py-self.

Version Related Info
---------------------

There are two main ways to query version information about the library. For guarantees, check :ref:`version_guarantees`.

.. data:: version_info

    A named tuple that is similar to :obj:`py:sys.version_info`.

    Just like :obj:`py:sys.version_info` the valid values for ``releaselevel`` are
    'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate' and 'final'.

.. data:: __version__

    A string representation of the version. e.g. ``'1.0.0rc1'``. This is based
    off of :pep:`440`.

Event Reference
---------------

This section outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`Client`.

There are two ways to register an event, the first way is through the use of
:meth:`Client.event`. The second way is through subclassing :class:`Client` and
overriding the specific events. For example: ::

    import discord

    class MyClient(discord.Client):
        async def on_message(self, message):
            if message.author != self.user:
                return

            if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
                await message.channel.send('Hello World!')


If an event handler raises an exception, :func:`on_error` will be called
to handle it, which defaults to logging the traceback and ignoring the exception.

.. warning::

    All the events must be a |coroutine_link|_. If they aren't, then you might get unexpected
    errors. In order to turn a function into a coroutine they must be defined with ``async def``.

AutoMod
~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_automod_rule_create(rule)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModRule` is created.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param rule: The rule that was created.
    :type rule: :class:`AutoModRule`

.. function:: on_automod_rule_update(rule)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModRule` is updated.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param rule: The rule that was updated.
    :type rule: :class:`AutoModRule`

.. function:: on_automod_rule_delete(rule)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModRule` is deleted.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param rule: The rule that was deleted.
    :type rule: :class:`AutoModRule`

.. function:: on_automod_action(execution)

    Called when a :class:`AutoModAction` is created/performed.
    You must have :attr:`~Permissions.manage_guild` to receive this.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param execution: The rule execution that was performed.
    :type execution: :class:`AutoModAction`

    :param channel: The guild channel that had its pins updated.
    :type channel: Union[:class:`abc.GuildChannel`, :class:`Thread`]

    :param channel: The private channel that got created or deleted.
    :type channel: :class:`abc.PrivateChannel`

.. function:: on_private_channel_update(before, after)

    :type user: :class:`User`

.. function:: on_typing(channel, user, when)

    Called when someone begins typing a message.

    The ``channel`` parameter can be a :class:`abc.Messageable` instance.
    Which could either be :class:`TextChannel`, :class:`GroupChannel`, or
    :class:`DMChannel`.

    If the ``channel`` is a :class:`TextChannel` then the ``user`` parameter

Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_connect()

    Called when the client has successfully connected to Discord. This is not
    the same as the client being fully prepared, see :func:`on_ready` for that.

    The warnings on :func:`on_ready` also apply.

.. function:: on_disconnect()

    Called when the client has disconnected from Discord, or a connection attempt to Discord has failed.
    This could happen either through the internet being disconnected, explicit calls to close,
    or Discord terminating the connection one way or the other.

    This function can be called many times without a corresponding :func:`on_connect` call.

Debug
~~~~~~

.. function:: on_error(event, *args, **kwargs)

    Usually when an event raises an uncaught exception, a traceback is
    logged to stderr and the exception is ignored. If you want to
    change this behaviour and handle the exception for whatever reason
    yourself, this event can be overridden. Which, when done, will
    suppress the default action of printing the traceback.

    The information of the exception raised and the exception itself can
    be retrieved with a standard call to :func:`sys.exc_info`.

    .. note::

        ``on_error`` will only be dispatched to :meth:`Client.event`.

        It will not be received by :meth:`Client.wait_for`, or, if used,
        :ref:`ext_commands_api_bot` listeners such as
        :meth:`~ext.commands.Bot.listen` or :meth:`~ext.commands.Cog.listener`.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0

        The traceback is now logged rather than printed.

    :param event: The name of the event that raised the exception.
    :type event: :class:`str`

    :param args: The positional arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.
    :param kwargs: The keyword arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.

.. function:: on_socket_event_type(event_type)

    Called whenever a websocket event is received from the WebSocket.

    This is mainly useful for logging how many events you are receiving
    from the Discord gateway.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param event_type: The event type from Discord that is received, e.g. ``'READY'``.
    :type event_type: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_receive(msg)

    Called whenever a message is completely received from the WebSocket, before
    it's processed and parsed. This event is always dispatched when a
    complete message is received and the passed data is not parsed in any way.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages received from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param msg: The message passed in from the WebSocket library.
    :type msg: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_send(payload)

    Called whenever a send operation is done on the WebSocket before the
    message is sent. The passed parameter is the message that is being
    sent to the WebSocket.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages sent from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param payload: The message that is about to be passed on to the
                    WebSocket library. It can be :class:`bytes` to denote a binary
                    message or :class:`str` to denote a regular text message.
    :type payload: Union[:class:`bytes`, :class:`str`]

Gateway
~~~~~~~~

.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client is done preparing the data received from Discord. Usually after login is successful
    and the :attr:`Client.guilds` and co. are filled up.

    .. warning::

        This function is not guaranteed to be the first event called.
        Likewise, this function is **not** guaranteed to only be called
        once. This library implements reconnection logic and thus will
        end up calling this event whenever a RESUME request fails.

.. function:: on_resumed()

    Called when the client has resumed a session.

        Audit log entries received through the gateway are subject to data retrieval
        from cache rather than REST. This means that some data might not be present
        when you expect it to be. For example, the :attr:`AuditLogEntry.target`
        attribute will usually be a :class:`discord.Object` and the
        :attr:`AuditLogEntry.user` attribute will depend on user and member cache.

        attributes will be of :class:`Object` rather than the respective models.

        Outside of those two attributes, the only other attribute guaranteed to be
        filled by the Discord gateway for this event is :attr:`Invite.code`.

    :type payload: :class:`RawMemberRemoveEvent`

.. function:: on_member_update(before, after)

.. function:: on_message(message)

    Called when a :class:`Message` is created and sent.

    .. warning::

        Your bot's own messages and private messages are sent through this
        event. This can lead cases of 'recursion' depending on how your bot was
        programmed. If you want the bot to not reply to itself, consider
        checking the user IDs. Note that :class:`~ext.commands.Bot` does not
        have this problem.

    :param message: The current message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_edit(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Message` receives an update event. If the message is not found
    in the internal message cache, then these events will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` event instead.

    The following non-exhaustive cases trigger this event:

    - A message has been pinned or unpinned.
    - The message content has been changed.
    - The message has received an embed.

        - For performance reasons, the embed server does not do this in a "consistent" manner.

    - The message's embeds were suppressed or unsuppressed.
    - A call message has received an update to its participants or ending time.

    :param before: The previous version of the message.
    :type before: :class:`Message`
    :param after: The current version of the message.
    :type after: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_delete(message)

    Called when a message is deleted. If the message is not found in the
    internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_delete` event instead.

    :param message: The deleted message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_bulk_message_delete(messages)

    Called when messages are bulk deleted. If none of the messages deleted
    are found in the internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    If individual messages were not found in the internal message cache,
    this event will still be called, but the messages not found will not be included in
    the messages list. Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_bulk_message_delete` event instead.

    :param messages: The messages that have been deleted.
    :type messages: List[:class:`Message`]

.. function:: on_message_ack(message, manual)

    Called when a message is marked as read. If the message is not found in the
    internal message cache, or the message ID is not real, then this event will not be called.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_ack` event instead.

    .. note::

        Messages sent by the current user are automatically marked as read,
        but this event will not dispatch.

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

    :param message: The message that has been marked as read.
    :type message: :class:`Message`
    :param manual: Whether the channel read state was manually set to this message.
    :type manual: :class:`bool`

.. function:: on_raw_message_edit(payload)

    Called when a message is edited. Unlike :func:`on_message_edit`, this is called
    regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`. The cached message represents
    the message before it has been edited. For example, if the content of a message is modified and
    triggers the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` coroutine, the :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`
    will return a :class:`Message` object that represents the message before the content was modified.

    Due to the inherently raw nature of this event, the data parameter coincides with
    the raw data given by the :ddocs:`gateway <topics/gateway#message-update>`.

    Since the data payload can be partial, care must be taken when accessing stuff in the dictionary.
    One example of a common case of partial data is when the ``'content'`` key is inaccessible. This
    denotes an "embed" only edit, which is an edit in which only the embeds are updated by the Discord
    embed server.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageUpdateEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a message is deleted. Unlike :func:`on_message_delete`, this is

    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageDeleteEvent.cached_message`

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_bulk_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a bulk delete is triggered. Unlike :func:`on_bulk_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the messages being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the messages are found in the message cache,
    they can be accessed via :attr:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent.cached_messages`

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_message_ack(payload)

    Called when a message is marked as read. Unlike :func:`on_message_ack`, this is
    called regardless of the message being in the internal message cache or not.

    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageAckEvent.cached_message`

    .. versionadded:: 2.1

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageAckEvent`

.. function:: on_recent_mention_delete(message)

    Called when a message you were mentioned in in the last week is acknowledged and deleted.
    If the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this event will not be called.

    :param message: The message that was deleted.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_raw_recent_mention_delete(message_id)

Abstract Base Classes
-----------------------

An :term:`abstract base class` (also known as an ``abc``) is a class that models can inherit
to get their behaviour. **Abstract base classes should not be instantiated**.
They are mainly there for usage with :func:`isinstance` and :func:`issubclass`\.

This library has a module related to abstract base classes, in which all the ABCs are subclasses of
:class:`typing.Protocol`.

Discord Models
---------------

Models are classes that are received from Discord and are not meant to be created by
the user of the library.

.. danger::

    The classes listed below are **not intended to be created by users** and are also
    **read-only**.

    For example, this means that you should not make your own :class:`User` instances
    nor should you modify the :class:`User` instance yourself.

    If you want to get one of these model classes instances they'd have to be through
    the cache, and a common way of doing so is through the :func:`utils.find` function
    or attributes of model classes that you receive from the events specified in the
    :ref:`discord-api-events`.

.. note::

    Nearly all classes here have :ref:`py:slots` defined which means that it is
    impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

Data Classes
--------------

Some classes are just there to be data containers, this lists them.

Unlike :ref:`models <discord_api_models>` you are allowed to create
most of these yourself, even if they can also be used to hold attributes.

Nearly all classes here have :ref:`py:slots` defined which means that it is
impossible to have dynamic attributes to the data classes.

The only exception to this rule is :class:`Object`, which is made with
dynamic attributes in mind.
